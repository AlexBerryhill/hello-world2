# Overview

This is a hello world with C++. Don't worry if you are looking at this as a hiring manager, I already have experience programming in C++ before I wrote this. Although I could not think of a better way to start a programming portfolio than saying hello world.

In this program you run it and it will play "hello world".

I have created this program to start off my portfolio.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

The programming language is C++, It might be considered difficult, but it is fast.
